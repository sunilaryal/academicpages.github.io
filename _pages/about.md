I am a lecturer in IT at the School of Information Technology, Faculty of Faculty of Science, Engineering and Built Environment, Deakin University Australia. Prior to joining Deakin University in 2019, I worked as a lecturer at Federation University Australia and sessional teaching staff at various institutions. Before moving to academia, I worked in industry as a data engineer and software developer for a number of years. I received my PhD from Monash University, Australia. My research is in the areas of data mining, machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am interested in applying IT to solve real-world problems in different domains, particularly in defence, healthcare, cyber security and IoT. I work in similarity measures, anomaly detection, classification, clustering, text/image analysis, ensemble learning, learning from small subsamples of data, and robust/explainable machine learning. I have published more than 25 scientific papers in top tier conferences and journals in the field of data mining and machine learning and have been a named investigator on research grants and contracts of over AUD 1.4 millions. 

<b>PhD scholarships available to strong domestic (Australian citizen or permanent resident) and onshore (already in Australia) international students to research in any area of AI, machine learning and data mining. If you are insterested, please send me your CV.</b>
