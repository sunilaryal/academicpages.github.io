I am a lecturer in IT and Early Career Researcher (ECR) at the School of Engineering and Information Technology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Federation University Australia. Prior to joining Federation University in 2016, I worked as a sessional teaching staff in various institutions. I also worked in industry as a software developer and data analyst. I received my PhD from Monash University, Australia. My research are in the areas of data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, health informatics, and information systems. I am particularly interested in applying IT to solve real-world problems in different domains. I am affiliated with the [Centre for Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Artificial Intelligence Research (MCCAIR)](https://federation.edu.au/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-science-and-technology/research/computational-science-and-mathematics/centre-for-multimedia-computing-communications-and-applications-research-mccar "MCCAIR"), [Centre for Informatics and Applied Optimization (CIAO)](https://federation.edu.au/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-science-and-technology/research/computational-science-and-mathematics/ciao "CIAO") and [Internet Commerce Security Laboratory (ICSL)](https://federation.edu.au/icsl "ICSL") at the Federation University.
