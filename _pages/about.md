I am a lecturer in IT at the School of Engineering and Information Technology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Federation University Australia. Prior to joining the Federation University, I worked as a sessional teaching staff in various institutions. I also worked in industry as a software developer and data analyst. I received my PhD degree from Monash University, Australia. My research is in the area of data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, health informatics, and information systems. I am particularly interested in applying IT to solve real-world problems in different domains. I am affiliated with the Centre for Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Artificial Intelligence Research (MCCAIR) and Centre for Informatics and Applied Optimization (CIAO) at the Federation University.
